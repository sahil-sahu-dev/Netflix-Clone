# Netflix-Clone

## Things I learned:

* My first UI Kit + programmatic UI iOS project (I've only worked with Swift-UI so far). 
* UI Kit- View controllers, delegates, Table Views, Collection Views, etc.
* Auto-Layout
* WebKit
* I used the YouTube API to fetch trailers for videos and show them through web kit
* I used the tmdb APIs to fetch data for trending movies, trending tv shows, popular movies, upcoming movies, top rated movies and even used their search API.
